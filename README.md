# AI Staff Roster Engine
This is an automated rostering engine built using Google OR-Tools to assign staff to shifts based on constraints that were given.

## Key Features
1. Ensures fairness in shift assignment using a point based system
2. Constraint Based:
  - Assigns staffs to shifts based on their roles.
  - Staff will not be able to work the next shift following a PM shift for safety reasons.
  - Staff will be entitled to take blackout dates where they would not be assigned a shift.
  - Staff will be able to bid for specific Public Holiday shifts which they would want to work on.
  - Staff will be taken out of pool for Public Holiday shifts if the shift is within 300 days of their last worked Public Holiday, unless they bidded for it.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.14+
- **Optimisation:** Google OR-Tools (CP-SAT Solver)
- **Interface:** Streamlit
- **Data Handling:** Pandas, Openpyxl
